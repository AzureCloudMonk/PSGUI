##  Short Description
########################################################################

3 months ago i started a project to create user interfaces for Powershell with WPF as simple as possible for everyone by using a  – POWERSHELL GUI.

Powershell GUI with Powershell GUI?! – sounds paradox – but hey – one example will be ready the whole time. :D

Many times there had been administrators, customers and friends who asked for a GUI in PS. Probably the loudest crying group had been the administrators who normally should work easily with Powershell. But IT-guys are lazy – and because of these laziness we create powerfull scripts which make life easier. And if a wonderfull looking GUI is on top of this functionality – even better!

Though you should never forget – by adding a GUI to a module / function of yours you can prevent lots of input errors by the user. The user gets happy because he can click and sees a wonderful design and you can add an additional abstraction layer preventing lots of headaches.

Aims

The primary aims with this project had been:

 everyone can do it
 structured and separated code by logic
 easy to create and deploy dialogs
 easy to manage multiple dialogs
 free code to use for everyone
 examples for small and easy but also further on more complex solutions
 preconfigured examples for some use-cases
 as many internal functions to avoid manual work
 no dependencies to proprietary programs
 
 Interested? then take a look into!
